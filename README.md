# BouncyBall-windows
My Bouncy Ball game for Windows

## Running the Game:
to run the game you need to intall the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

If the package is installed you simply need to put the run BallGame3D.exe in the folder which contains the lvl/ pics/ and lib/ subdirectories. The BallGame.zip contains all files necessary to run it without any of the source code. so if you just download and extract it everything should work properly. but i didn't really test this game on any other machines then my own laptop, so it might not work

## Additional Info
I Developed this game serveral years ago in order to learn how to use openGL.
Now i put it on GitHub for everybody to download (and improve), so feel free to download, share and modify anything you want to!
Sadly i didn't use git at that time, so there is only this one commit.

The levels are stored as text files in the ./lvl/ directory. if you make your own levels feel free push them to this project so others can enjoy them to.

I developed this using VisualStudio (2010 iirc), so using it to will probably help if you want to modify anything.
