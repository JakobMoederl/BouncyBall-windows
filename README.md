# BouncyBall-windows
My Bouncy Ball game for Windows

I Developed this game serveral years ago in order to learn how to use openGL.
Now i put it on GitHub for everybody to download (and improve), so feel free to download, share and modify anything you want to!
Sadly i didn't use git at that time, so there is only this one commit.

The levels are stored as text files in the ./lvl/ directory. if you make your own levels feel free push them to this project so others can enjoy them to.

I developed this using VisualStudio (2010 iirc), so using it to will probably help if you want to modify anything.
